## Read most out of a paper with the least effort

### Phase 1: Survey.

> Is it really worth investing a lot of time with?

**Feel free to stop reading the article at any point when you become disinterested in going further.**

1. Read the title and keywords.(what got you to look at the paper)
2. Read abstract.
3. Read the conclusions.

### Phase 2: How to Read a Article

1. Look at the tables and figures(including captions).

   > This is really what was done in the work.  This does not take much time so it is worth looking at before really getting into the details which will slow down the reading.

2. Read the introduction.

   > This is the background needed and why the study was done.

3. Read the results and discussion.

   > This is the heart of the paper.

4. Read the experimental.

   >This is how they did the work. You only get to this point if yo are really interested and need to understand exactly what was done to better understand the meaning of the data and its interpretation.
